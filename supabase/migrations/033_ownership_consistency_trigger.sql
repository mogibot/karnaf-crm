-- Karnaf CRM Core - Ownership consistency check.
--
-- Audit flagged: leads.ownership_mode can diverge from
-- conversations.ownership_mode. When the orchestrator updates one row
-- without the other (rare but possible during migration or via a buggy
-- function), inbound messages route to the wrong owner.
--
-- This trigger fires on conversation row updates and logs to
-- integration_logs whenever the conversation's ownership doesn't match
-- the lead's. We don't auto-correct because the truth depends on
-- which side moved first; surface for /admin/health to triage.
